# Program 7 — Find the temperature where Celsius equals Fahrenheit

# ---- Code ----
# From the formula: C = (F - 32) * 5/9.
# Setting C = F and solving gives C = -40.
print("Celsius and Fahrenheit are equal at -40 degrees.")

# ---- Explanation (line by line) ----
# 1) (comment) From the formula: C = (F - 32) * 5/9.
#    - This relates Celsius to Fahrenheit.
# 2) (comment) Set C = F -> C = (C - 32) * 5/9 -> 9C = 5C - 160 -> 4C = -160 -> C = -40.
#    - Algebra steps to solve the equality.
# 3) print("Celsius and Fahrenheit are equal at -40 degrees.")
#    - Prints the final answer directly.
